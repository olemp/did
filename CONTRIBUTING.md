## Development

**NB: Did should be developed with node >=12.18.3**



### Getting started

1. Check out the dev branch
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run-script create-env` to create your own `.env` file for local testing
4. Set neccessary parameters in your new `.env` file (see `Set up .env` below)
5. Install the [Azure App Service extension for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice)
6. Install the [ESLint extension for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
7. Install the [i18n Ally extension for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)
8. Create an Azure app registration, or ask one of the [maintainers](#maintainers) for access to an existing one
9. Run `npm run-script watch` to watch both `server` and `client` changes concurrently  

The following permissions are required by Azure App Registration:

#### Set up .env ##

You've copied `.env.sample` into `.env`, anually or using `npm run-script create-env`.

Now you need to set the required environment variables from this table:

| Key                             | Description                                                  | Required |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| OAUTH_APP_ID                    | ID of the AD application registration.                       | **Yes**  |
| OAUTH_APP_PASSWORD              | Password/key of the AD application registration.             | **Yes**  |
| AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING | Connection string for the Azure Table Storage                | **Yes**  |
| SESSION_SIGNING_KEY             | Just a random string to secure the sessions.                 | **Yes**  |
| BUNDLE_ANALYZER_MODE            | See https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer. Default is server. | No       |
| *OPEN_DELA*Y                    | Delay in seconds for opening Did in browser when running `watch`. | No       |
| DEBUG                           | To debug the Node backend. E.g. `app*` to see all logs from app. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug. | No       |
| NO_BROWSER                      | Set to `1` if you don't want to automatically open Did in the browser when running `watch` task. | No       |
| OAUTH_SCOPES                    | Scopes for Microsoft Graph queries. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent. | No       |

### Commits
We are using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) hooks to automatically run npm script `lint:fix` before commits. This is to make sure all files are linted and ready to go at all times. This is easy to forget when working on a branch.

You ***can** (but shouldn't) bypass pre-commit and commit-msg hooks using Git `--no-verify` option:

```shell
git commit -m "yolo!" --no-verify
```

For Git commands that don't have a `--no-verify` option, you can use HUSKY environment variable:

```shell
HUSKY=0 git push # yolo!
```

We are also using the `commit-msg` hook to enforce good commit messages with [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional).

See `commitlint` in [package.json](./package.json). The commit message needs to be lowercase and have a prefix.

### Branching / Deploying

The `/main` branch requires pull requests, and is set up with a CI/CD pipeline which deploys to [did365.puzzlepart.com](https://did365.puzzlepart.com)  
The `/dev` branch also requires pull requests, and is set up with a CI/CD pipeline which deploys to [didapp.azurewebsites.net](https://didapp.azurewebsites.net)  
`/feature/*`-prefixed branches may or may not be included in future releases.

You are encouraged to branch with either of the following prefixes  
*  **hotfix/**
*  **bugfix/**
*  **feature/**

See also ["A successful Git branching model"](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)


If you want to test with your web app, checkout [Creating your own app registration in the Azure Portal](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/did365/wiki/Creating-your-own-app-registration-in-the-Azure-Portal) in our wiki.


### GraphQL

The extension [Apollo extension for VS Code](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/) is recommended for working with GraphQL in vscode.

> The Apollo [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) provides an all-in-one tooling experience for developing apps with Apollo.
>
> The extension enables you to:
>
> - Add [syntax highlighting](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#syntax-highlighting) for GraphQL files and gql templates inside JavaScript files
> - Get instant feedback and [intelligent autocomplete](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#intelligent-autocomplete) for fields, arguments, types, and variables as you write queries
> - Manage client side schema alongside remote schema
> - See [performance information](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#performance-insights) inline with your query definitions
> - Validate field and argument usage in operations
> - [Navigate projects more easily](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#navigating-projects) with jump-to and peek-at definitions
> - Manage [client-only](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#client-only-schemas) schemas
> - [Switch graph variants](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/#graph-variant-switching) to work with schemas running on different environments



## Documentation

The client is documented [here](./client/.docs/README.md) and the server is documented [here](./server/.docs/README.md).

_We use https://studio.apollographql.com/ for GraphQL schema documentation._
